            <p> My programming abilities go back to high school. I have been programming since the age of 16. In high school,
                I started a robotics club called Robo Huskies. We participated in BEST Robotics competitions and Sea Perch competitions.
                <br><br>During my sophomore year at Temple University College of Engineering I reactivated the robotics club Creative Robotics at Temple University (C.R.A.T.E). In a Vex Robotics Challenge Competition, C.R.A.T.E placed 2nd and won against several other opponents as well as a team formed by seniors from Temple University College of Engineering (they formed a team for their senior project). In the same year I worked as a Teacher Assistant for Introduction to Engineering where I helped teach aspiring engineering students how to build and program hovercrafts using Arduino boards. Because of my initiatives, accomplishments and projects, in my junior year I was nominated as the Pennsylvania State Representative for the NASA Space Grant Program.
                <br><br>I then took a three year hiatus to find myself and where I belong in this world. During my break I took programming courses at the Community College of Philadelphia and received a Computer Programming and Software Development Proficiency Certificate, I also completed the New York Design Code Academy Web Development Intensive 250 hour Course.
                In addition to the above, in the summer of 2012, I worked in the Haptics Lab at the University of Pennsylvania as a research assistant. I also have attended various hackathons, volunteered for several lego league competitions where I helped teams with building and programming their robots. In 2013, I was a core values judge for the Lego League Championship at the University of Pennsylvania.
