            <p>
              My name is Raven Hooper and I am a Full-Stack Developer and Programmer. I have been programming for 9 years.
              Front-end programming; html, css, javascript for 3 years and backend programming ruby on rails and node.js
              for less than a year. I have a web developer certificate from the New York Design Code Academy for their
              Web Development Intensive 250 hour Course. I have a certificate of completion from the Community College of
              Philadelphia for Computer Programming and Software Development Proficiency.
              <br><br>
              <strong>  A Bit About Myself</strong>  <br>
              My programming abilities date back to high school. In high school, at the age of 16, I started a robotics club
              called Robo Huskies. We built, designed and programmed robots. We programmed the robots using either java,
              Best Robotics kit, or arduino code.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Accomplishments</strong>  <br>
              During my sophomore year at Temple University College of Engineering I reactivated the robotics club Creative
              Robotics at Temple University (C.R.A.T.E). In a Vex Robotics Challenge Competition, C.R.A.T.E placed 2nd and
              won against several other opponents as well as a team formed by seniors from Temple University College of
              Engineering (they formed a team for their senior project). In the same year I worked as a Teacher Assistant
              for Introduction to Engineering where I helped teach aspiring engineering students how to build and program
              hovercrafts using arduino boards and ipads. Because of my initiatives, accomplishments and projects, in my
              junior year I was nominated as the Pennsylvania State Representative for the NASA Space Grant Program.
              <br><br>
              In addition to the above I worked in the Haptics Lab at the University of Pennsylvania as a research assistant.
              In 2016, I participated in Drexelâ€™s Dragon Hacks 24-hr hackathon. I have volunteered for several lego league
              competitions; I helped teams build and program their robots using Lego NXT Mindstorm kits. In 2013, I was a Core
              Values Judge for the Lego League Championship at the University of Pennsylvania.
