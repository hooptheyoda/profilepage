              Critical thinker, quick learner of new software applications and detail oriented. I am always willing to learn new things
              and enjoy creating applications.
              <br><br>
              <strong>  A Bit About Myself</strong>  <br>
              My name is Raven, I am a Full-Stack Developer and Programmer. Front-end programming; html, css,
              javascript for 3+ years. Backend programming node.js for 3 years and ruby on rails a year. I am certified in
              Web Development, Computer Programming and Software Development.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Accomplishments</strong>  <br>
              During my sophomore year at Temple University College of Engineering I reactivated the robotics club Creative
              Robotics at Temple University (C.R.A.T.E). In a Vex Robotics Challenge Competition, C.R.A.T.E placed 2nd and
              won against several other opponents as well as a team formed by seniors from Temple University College of
              Engineering (they formed a team for their senior project). In the same year I worked as a Teacher Assistant
              for Introduction to Engineering where I helped teach aspiring engineering students how to build and program
              hovercrafts using arduino boards and ipads. Because of my initiatives, accomplishments and projects, in my
              junior year I was nominated as the <a style="color: #777;" href="http://news.psu.edu/story/299174/2014/01/02/impact/penn-state-run-pennsylvania-space-grant-program-turns-25">Pennsylvania State Representative for the NASA Space Grant Program</a>.
              I receieved funding from Nasa for my projects.
              <br><br>
              In addition to the above I worked in the Haptics Lab at the University of Pennsylvania as a research assistant.
              In 2016, I participated in Drexelâ€™s Dragon Hacks 24-hr hackathon. In January of 2013 I ran a program at
              Philadelphia School for the Deaf where I taught highschoolers 9-12th grade how to program parallax robots.
              I have volunteered for Girls in Engineering, Mathmatics and Science (Gems) where I taught middle school Girls
              how to program, build robots and create/present presentations. I have volunteered for several lego league competitions;
              I helped teams build and program their robots using Lego NXT Mindstorm kits. In 2013, I was a Core Values Judge for
              the Lego League Championship at the University of Pennsylvania.
